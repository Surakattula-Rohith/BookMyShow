## Project Description

One of the best projects I’ve worked on is the **Book My Show** movie booking application. It featured three user roles—Admin, Partner, and Customer—with functionalities such as secure authentication using JWT, password encryption with bcrypt, and real-time notifications. One of the challenges was integrating **Stripe** for payments and ensuring seamless email notifications, which required close collaboration between frontend and backend services. This experience taught me the importance of designing scalable and maintainable code.
